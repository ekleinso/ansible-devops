# NOTE: Eg for OpenShift 4.5.2 We look for backup_script-4.5.2.sh first
#       if missing, we will look for backup_script-4.5.sh next.
#       When OpenShift 4.6 comes out we will need to have a new backup_script
#       added for 4.6. Also if in future OpenShift 4.5.10 come up with a
#       breaking change we can added backup_script-4.5.10.sh to overcome.
